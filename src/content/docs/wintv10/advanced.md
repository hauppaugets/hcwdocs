### Command Line Parameters for WinTV10.exe

<th>-</th>
<th>Opens another instance of WinTV10. To explain: If WinTV10 is already running, and you double-click on the WinTV10 icon again, normally the already running program is just brought into foreground. But if WinTV8.exe is run with the parameter "-multi", another WinTV10 window is opened. So you could watch live TV in one window and play a recording in a second window. On a dual tuner product you can watch live TV in two WinTV10 windows.</th>

It is recommended to create a new WinTV10 icon and add the command line parameter under its properties. Following an example with the parameter "-multi":

1. Create a copy of the WinTV10-Icon on your desktop, by selecting the icon and pressing \<Ctrl\> C ("Copy"), and then \<Ctrl\> V ("Paste").

2. Right-click on the new icon and select "Properties" from the context menu.

3. Select the "Shortcut" tab. In the "Target:" field, after the program call add a space, and then the parameter, like this:\
   "C:\Program Files\WinTV\WinTV10\WinTV10.exe" -multi

Now, each time you double click on the new icon, a new WinTV10 window will be opened.
